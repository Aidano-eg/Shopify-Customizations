  Steps to Implement:

    Find the Collection Product Loop
        Open your Shopify theme editor.
        Go to Sections > collection-template.liquid or Snippets > product-card.liquid (or whichever file renders products in the collection).

    Modify the Image Display Logic
        By default, Shopify loads product.featured_image. You need to select a random variant’s image instead.
        Use Shopify Liquid to randomly pick a variant image.

Explanation:

    The code checks if a product has more than one variant.
    It uses the current timestamp ("now" | date: "%N") to generate a pseudo-random number.
    This number is used to pick a random variant from the product’s variants.
    The image of the selected variant is displayed instead of the default product image.

Additional Considerations:

    If a product has variants without images, you might need to add a fallback to ensure an image is always displayed.
    Shopify Liquid doesn’t support true randomness directly, so the randomness comes from the timestamp, which will appear random to users.

This should dynamically display a different color variant for each product in your collection pages without altering your product structure. Let me know if you need modifications!
